      <p>
        The affinity diagram organizes ideas to help college students manage their work better. It has different categories: Advertisement includes ways to promote the app, like social media ads and working with influencers. Design focuses on features like a simple interface and dark mode. Product Ideas suggest tools like automated reminders and progress trackers. Hurdles identify challenges, such as getting users to adopt the app and facing competition. Privacy Settings is about keeping user data safe and giving control over it. This clear structure helps understand the app's key elements.

      <p>The sketches show three different perspectives of how someone would interact with the app. One is if someone wants to list homework they have, another is if someone wants to make flashcards, and another is if someone wants to find a friend on the app.</p>
